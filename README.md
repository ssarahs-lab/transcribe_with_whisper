# transcribe_with_whisper

## Backstory
One of my friends was writing notes for her psychology lectures and had been telling me that her lecturer spoke so fast that she was rewinding every minute or so to make sure her notes were correct.  As a friend, I thought I'd help her out by making a program to transcribe all the audio :) 

### TLDR: 
Friend writing notes for lectures, I made a program to transcribe it all for her.

 

## What did I learn?
- Revised Python f-strings
- Revised opening a file 
- Creating and writing a text file in Python

## Next time
- Make a user-friendly GUI for the program
